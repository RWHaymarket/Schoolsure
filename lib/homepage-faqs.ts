    question: "What is SchoolSure?",
    answer:
      "SchoolSure is a specialist insurance brand that protects Australian families against the financial risk of interrupted schooling. If something happens to the primary fee payer — serious illness, critical injury, or death — SchoolSure pays your child's school fees directly to the school so their education continues without disruption.\n\nWe're a retail brand of Niche Insurance Pty Ltd, an AFSL-licensed managing general agency with underwriting backed by Lloyd's of London.",

      "Yes. Niche Insurance holds Australian Financial Services Licence No. 530784, issued by ASIC. We're required to meet strict compliance, capital, and conduct obligations.

    question: "Is this the same as income protection insurance?",
    answer:
      "No — and this is an important distinction. Income protection replaces a percentage of your salary if you can't work. It doesn't guarantee your child stays in their school.\n\nSchoolSure pays school fees directly to the school, ensuring educational continuity regardless of what happens to your household income. Many families have income protection AND school fee protection because they solve different problems.",

    category: "How it works",
    question: "How do I get a quote?",
    answer:
      "Enter your child's school and annual fee, choose your cover level, and provide a few personal details. The whole process takes under two minutes. You'll receive an instant quote with no obligation and no medical screening required.",

  {
    category: "How it works",
    question: "Do I need a medical examination?",
    answer:
      "No. SchoolSure uses a moratorium approach — no health questionnaires, no GP visits, no medical screening of any kind.\n\nInstead, pre-existing conditions diagnosed within the five years before your policy start date are excluded. Conditions diagnosed more than five years prior are covered. This keeps the process fast and accessible for all families.",

    category: "How it works",
    question: "When does cover start?",
    answer:
      "For Parent Continuity Cover, death and terminal illness cover starts immediately from policy inception. All other covered events (critical illness, temporary disablement, permanent disablement) have a 30-day waiting period.\n\nFor Placement Insurance, cover starts immediately with no waiting period.",

    category: "How it works",
    question: "How are claims paid?",
    answer:
      "SchoolSure pays fees directly to your child's school — not to you personally. This ensures the money goes exactly where it's needed: keeping your child in school.\n\nWhen you make a claim, you first engage with your school's own hardship process (if applicable), and SchoolSure pays the net remaining fee after any school-provided relief.",

    category: "How it works",
    question: "Can I cover more than one child?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. You can add multiple children to a single policy. Each additional child receives a 10% multi-child discount on their total premium. There's no limit to the number of children you can cover, and they don't need to attend the same school.",
  },
  {
    category: "Pricing and payment",
    question: "How much does SchoolSure cost?",
    answer:
      "Parent Continuity Cover is priced at 2.5% of your annual school fee, with a minimum premium of $250 per year. For a school charging $25,000 per year, that's $625 annually — roughly $1.71 per day.\n\nStudent Continuity Cover adds 1% of your annual fee, and School Expenses Cover is a flat $50 per child. Placement Insurance is a one-off payment from $25. Use our quote calculator for your exact premium.",

    category: "Pricing and payment",
    question: "Can I pay monthly?",
    answer:
      "Yes. You can choose to pay annually or monthly by direct debit. Annual payment attracts a 10% discount compared to the monthly rate. Both options are available during the quote process.",
  },
  {
    category: "Pricing and payment",
    question: "Is school fee insurance tax deductible?",
    answer:
      "SchoolSure premiums are generally not tax deductible for individual families, as school fees are considered a personal expense.\n\nHowever, if school fees are paid through a family trust or business structure, we recommend consulting your accountant or financial adviser about your specific circumstances. SchoolSure does not provide tax advice.",

    question: "Is redundancy covered?",
    answer:
      "Not at launch. Redundancy presents complex underwriting challenges — particularly given the evolving impact of AI on employment patterns and the high proportion of self-employed parents in the independent school sector.\n\nWe're actively investigating contained-risk structures for redundancy and business failure cover as a future product enhancement.",
  },
  {
    category: "Cover details",
    question: "What schools are eligible?",
    answer:
      "SchoolSure covers students attending registered non-government schools in Australia. This includes independent schools, Catholic schools, and other fee-paying institutions.\n\nThe school must charge tuition fees and be registered with the relevant state or territory education authority. We cover schools across all fee levels, from $5,000 to $45,000+ per year.",
  },
  {
    category: "Cover details",
    question: "What happens when I need to renew?",
    answer:
      "SchoolSure policies are annual. Before your renewal date, we'll contact you with your updated premium reflecting any changes to your school fees.\n\nRenewals include a 5% annual loading to account for school fee inflation. You can adjust your cover level, add or remove children, or cancel at renewal. There's no penalty for not renewing.",
